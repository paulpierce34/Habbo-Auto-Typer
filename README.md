# Habbo-Auto-Typer
This is a simple tool written in PowerShell (native to Windows) that will auto-type for you in Habbo (or other apps). The purpose of creating this tool is so you don't have to download sketchy 3rd-party software simply for an auto-type function

## HOW TO USE
- Git clone or copy/paste this script onto your machine and save as .ps1 file
- Modify sleep timer/custom message
- Execute script

There are two ways to execute a powershell script. One would be opening in Powershell ISE and clicking the green 'Play' button as shown in GIF #1. The other would be typing .\Habbo-AutoTyper.ps1 in a regular powershell window (GIF #2)
